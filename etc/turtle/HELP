Welcome to the Turtle Shell - an interactive menu
driven front end to this Linux based network utility.

CONFIG
 From the configuration menu you may manage basic aspects
 of the LAN TURTLE such as root password, IP and MAC 
 addresses, and check for updates.

 It is highly recommended to use the update feature, 
 especially with a new LAN Turtle as new features, bug
 fixes, additional modules and other improcements are 
 constantly being made.

 You may also disable the turtle shell, which will 
 prevent the interactive menu from starting upon SSH
 connection.

 From the terminal, modules may be started or stopped
 using the syntax "start sshfs" or "stop sshfs".
 The interactive Turtle Shell may be reached from the
 terminal by using the "turtle" command.

MODULES
 At the core of the LAN Turtle are the modules.
 Modules may be started, stopped, enabled for auto-
 start, disabled from auto-starting and configured.

 Some modules feature a help dialog within their
 configuration menus.

 Additional information on modules, module updates,
 writing your own module and downloading many more
 community contributed modules can be found from
